Issues:
when attempting to git push origin master, this came up:
To https://github.com/lenjha/witcherie-2.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/lenjha/witcherie-2.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Epicodus-2D:witcherie-2 Guest$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
Epicodus-2D:witcherie-2 Guest$ git pull state master
fatal: 'state' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
